## A simple digital clock that displays according to the 12 hours system.
### I have downloaded a special digital looking font 
### It is very easy to use an external font. 
After uploading the font using 
@font-face {
  font-family: digitalClock;
  src: url("./digital-7.ttf");
} inside the css should be enough.
You can use the digitalClock as font family anywhere inside the css file
